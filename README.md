# DESCRIPTION :

As a task of CODTECH internship, I built a Real-time collaborative code editor.I have created a real-time collaborative document editor using React.js for a dynamic and responsive user interface, MongoDB for efficient data storage, and Node.js as the backend framework.It allows multiple users to type and edit together at the same time. The changes are shared instantly using WebSocket, so everyone sees the same text live. The design is simple and clean, with a dark editor box for easy typing.
How It Works:

-When a user types in the text editor, the changes are broadcast instantly to all connected users using WebSocket.

-All users see updates in real time, making it ideal for team collaboration, coding sessions, or live note-taking.

-The design uses a clean UI with a white background and black editor box to simulate a "dark mode" writing space inside a bright layout.
